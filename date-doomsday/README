Date-DayOfWeek

There are several modules in this distribution. 
Date::Doomsday calculates doomsday for a particular year.
Date::DayOfWeek uses the doomsday algorithm to calculate the day 
of the week for any given date.

Date::DayOfWeek::Birthday, Date::DayOfWeek::Sneeze and
Date::DayOfWeek::Nails are three modules illustrating some of the
things that have been believed, at some point in history, as
attributes of the various days of the week.

Doomsday is a cute little idea invented by Dr John Conway that makes it very
easy to figure out the day of the week for any date.

You can find out more about doomsday and related calculations at

This module is distributed under the same terms as Perl itself.
