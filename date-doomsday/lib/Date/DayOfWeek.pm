    $dow = dayofweek( 25, 10, 1971 );
    $dow = dayofweek( 4, 7, 1776 );

Returns the day of the week for any date between 1500 and 2699.

    my ($day, $month, $year) = @_;

    # When is doomsday this year?

    # And when is doomsday this month?

    my @base = ( 0, 0, 7, 4, 9, 6, 11, 8, 5, 10, 7, 12 );
    @base[0,1] = Date::Leapyear::isleap($year) ? (32,29) : (31,28);

    # And how far after that are we?
    my $on = $day - $base[$month - 1];
    $on = $on % 7;
    
    # So, the day of the week should be doomsday, plus however far on we are
    return ($doomsday + $on) % 7;
