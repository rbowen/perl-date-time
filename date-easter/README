NAME
    Date::Easter - Calculates Easter for any given year

SYNOPSIS
      use Date::Easter;
      ($month, $day) = julian_easter(1752);
      ($month, $day) = easter(1753);
      ($month, $day) = gregorian_easter(1753);
      ($month, $day) = orthodox_easter(1823);

DESCRIPTION
    Calculates Easter for a given year.

    easter() is, for the moment, an alias to gregorian_easter(), since
    that's what most people use now. The thought was to somehow know which
    of the other methods to call, that that proved to be rather sticky.

    Date::Easter provides the following functions:

  julian_easter
        ( $month, $day ) = julian_easter( $year );

    Returns the month and day of easter in the given year, in the Julian
    calendar.

  gregorian_easter
        ( $month, $day ) = gregorian_easter( $year );

    Returns the month and day of easter in the given year, in the Gregorian
    calendar, which is what most of the world uses.

  easter
        ( $month, $day ) = easter( $year );

    Returns the month and day of easter in the given year, in the Gregorian
    calendar, which is what most of the world uses.

  orthodox_easter
        ( $month, $day ) = orthodox_easter( $year );

    Returns the month and day of easter in the given year, in the Orthodox
    calendar.

    From code by Pascalis Ligdas, based on original code by Apostolos
    Syropoulos

To Do
    Since the dates that various countries switched to the Gregorian
    calendar vary greatly, it's hard to figure out when to use which method.
    Perhaps some sort of locale checking would be cool?

    I need to test the Julian easter calculations, but I'm a little confused
    as to the difference between the Orthodox Easter and the Julian Easter.
    I need to read some more.

    The use of localtime and timelocal locks us into the epoch, which is a
    rather silly limitation. Need to move to Date::DayOfWeek or other module
    to calculate the day of the week. This should immediately make the
    module usable back to the beginning of celebration of Easter.

Other Comments
    Yes, Date::Manip already has code in it to do this. But Date::Manip is
    very big, and rather slow. I needed something faster and smaller, and
    did not need all that other stuff. And I have a real interest in date
    calculations, so I thought this would be fun. Date::Manip is a very cool
    module. I use it myself.

    See also http://www.pauahtun.org/CalendarFAQ/cal/node3.html for more
    details on calculating Easter.

    And many thanks to Simon Cozens who provided me with the code for the
    orthodox_easter function.

    The tests are taken from a table at

    The script 'easter' is just a simple way to find out when easter falls
    in a given year. Type 'easter' to find easter for this year, and 'easter
    1983' to find when easter falls in 1983.
