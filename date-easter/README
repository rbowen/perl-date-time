NAME
    Date::Easter - Calculates Easter for any given year

SYNOPSIS
      use Date::Easter;
      ($month, $day) = julian_easter(1752);
      ($month, $day) = easter(1753);
      ($month, $day) = gregorian_easter(1753);
      ($month, $day) = orthodox_easter(1823);

DESCRIPTION
    Calculates Easter for a given year.

    easter() is simply an alias to gregorian_easter(), since that's what
    almost every country in the world currently uses.

    Date::Easter provides the following functions:

  julian_easter
        ( $month, $day ) = julian_easter( $year );

    Returns the month and day of easter in the given year, in the Julian
    calendar.

  gregorian_easter
        ( $month, $day ) = gregorian_easter( $year );

    Returns the month and day of easter in the given year, in the Gregorian
    calendar, which is what most of the world uses.

  easter
        ( $month, $day ) = easter( $year );

    Returns the month and day of easter in the given year, in the Gregorian
    calendar, which is what most of the world uses.

  orthodox_easter
        ( $month, $day ) = orthodox_easter( $year );

    Returns the month and day of easter in the given year, in the Orthodox
    calendar.

    From code by Pascalis Ligdas, based on original code by Apostolos
    Syropoulos

To Do
    The use of localtime and timelocal locks us into the epoch, which is a
    rather silly limitation. Need to move to Date::DayOfWeek or other module
    to calculate the day of the week. This should immediately make the
    module usable back to the beginning of celebration of Easter.

Other Comments
    Note that Date::Manip also has code to do this, and you should
    probably use that module instead. This module was written as an
    academic exercise, since I an intrigued by calendrical calculations.
    On the other hand, Date::Manip is huge, so you might want to use
    this for that consideration. YMMV.

    See also http://www.pauahtun.org/CalendarFAQ/cal/node3.html for more
    details on calculating Easter.

    And many thanks to Simon Cozens who provided me with the code for the
    orthodox_easter function.

    The tests are taken from a table at

    The script 'easter' is just a simple way to find out when easter falls
    in a given year. Type 'easter' to find easter for this year, and 'easter
    1983' to find when easter falls in 1983.
